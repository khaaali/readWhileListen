   Foreword
   The Reawakening of Dharmic and Native Traditions
   There are two major groups of religions in the world today. First are the
   conversion-based religions of Christianity and Islam. Each holds that it is
   the only true faith for humanity and solely represents God&#x27;s plan and
   God&#x27;s will. Both reflect an exclusivist ethos of One God, a single holy
   book, a final prophet or single savior, an historical revelation, salvation
   from sin, and heaven or hell as the ultimate resting-place for the soul.
   Christianity and Islam became the dominant religions of the Western
   world over the centuries through a long process of struggle and warfare,
   as they displaced, often cruelly, all other religions that came in their path.
   Both conversion-based religions are based on an older Jewish
   monotheistic tradition that was critical of the diverse Pagan cults around
   it. They turned this rejection, which for the Jews was meant to preserve
   their own culture, into an article of faith and a need to eradicate all other
   beliefs.
   The second major group of world religions are the dharmic or meditation
   traditions of India - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - of which
   Hinduism is the oldest and largest. Chinese Taoism and Japanese Shinto
   have an affinity with these and can easily be placed among them.
   Dharmic traditions reflect a spiritual ethos of natural law (dharma),
   karma and rebirth, yogic practices, and a pursuit of direct experience of
   truth and self-realization through meditation. They became the dominant
   religions of the Eastern world, not through any process of intimidation,
   but by growing up organically with the cultures of these lands. Dharmic
   traditions define the Divine more as an impersonal and timeless
   consciousness than the personal Creator of Biblical traditions. They are
   tolerant and pluralistic and can accept other spiritual paths as valid and
   have no need to displace them.

   In addition there are various indigenous traditions and native creeds like
   those of the pre-Christian Europeans, the ancient Egyptians and
   Babylonians, and the many Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander and
   African groups. These appear more like the dharmic traditions of the East
   than the conversion-based religions of the West, which disdainfully call
   them pagans, heathens, kafirs or barbarians - the same terms that they use
   to characterize dharmic approaches. Like dharmic traditions these native
   ways have an experiential spirituality, ritual worship, use of images,
   multiplistic ideas of divinity, connection to the Earth and nature, and the
   recognition of a Great Spirit, though perhaps not as clearly defined as in
   dharmic paths.
   As the world has now moved out of colonial domination by monotheistic
   creeds, a new respect for Eastern dharmic traditions is arising
   everywhere. The impersonal consciousness of Indic traditions has much
